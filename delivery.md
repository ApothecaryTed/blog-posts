Las Vegas Marijuana Delivery 

2016 saw Marijuana delivery hit select dispensaries to the acclaim of many 
medical marijuana card owners. People no longer needed to travel across town 
after work nor dodge taxis to pick up a prescription. Marijuana delivery takes 
a burden off the consumer and allows us to reach more people with our products.

Marijuana delivery provides the people of Las Vegas a safe, legal, and convenient 
way to receive medicine.  Some patients use medical marijuana to relieve chronic 
pain or muscular conditions;  it is an undue burden to ask those patients to 
travel when it may be difficult for them to leave the house or to arrange 
transportation.

Other patients use marijuana to relieve anxiety.  Some find it difficult to be 
in a crowded setting - a busy dispensary, for instance.  Vegas weed delivery 
allows us to provide medicine to patients in the comfort of their own home. 
Anything we can do to provide patients a comfortable situation while awaiting 
their treatment is green in our book!
