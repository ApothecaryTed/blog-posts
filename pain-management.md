marijuana. Some strains benefit certain aspects and ailments more than others,
such as anxiety, depression, sleep deprivation, etc.—but what is the best strain
for pain? How do you decide which strain to choose? When it comes to medical
marijuana for pain management, here are the top strains available.

Medical Marijuana for Pain Management

If you suffer from pain of any kind, some consumptions methods work better than
others. Some patients prefer smoking marijuana, while for others, the
recommended ingestion of medical marijuana for pain management is through
edibles.

Edibles can be better for your lungs, and they also deliver a more potent
concentration to the affected area. The only downside is that it may take 30
minutes, and in some cases, up to a few hours, to kick in. So, if it’s fast
relief you want, cannabidiol oil (CBD) for pain management tends to be very
effective.

However you decide to take your medical marijuana or cannabinoids pain relief
options, it’s important to choose the right strains.
