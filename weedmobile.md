Las Vegas, NV, July 5, 2017: With recreational marijuana sales now in effect, one shop has a
unique idea that since last Saturday has been putting them well apart from all the other dispensaries in
Vegas, or Nevada, or the USA or even the WORLD! The concept of having a truck and wrapping it in 10’
tall signs is nothing new. However, the one The Apothecary Shoppe owns takes it further, way further with
what is dubbed the world’s 1st “Weedmobile” – complete with a 5.5’ tall “Bud” picture that comes from their
grow. There’s also the 6’ tall “Mortimer Hawkins” which is the mascot/welcomer of the Shoppe.
And it wouldn’t be a Marijuana advertisement without “weed-green” colored LED lights surrounding each of
the 14’ tall signs. To top it all off they have a full speaker system on all sides of the truck so that you can hear it
coming by the music playing, as well as a disco light system in the cab to add that feel good party-type feel and
even the Vegas classic – fuzzy white dice hanging in the front window.
The sign directs you to their phone number, 1-833-GOT-HERB, a play on the “Got Milk” ads we all know
and love. It says, “Call for a FREE ride” which is exactly what the shoppe wants – being that the tourists all over
Vegas and Downtown were left high and dry by lawmakers who still won’t allow deliveries to someone who is
not a Nevada Resident and a medical patient. This way every person from anywhere in the world can get a free
ride and get their herb without issue. GThe truck is ridden on a fixed route on LV BLVD from Mandalay Bay all
the way to Freemont Street and back again and can be seen mornings, noon and night – even late night!
The Apothecary Shoppe is located 1 minute from the Las Vegas Strip, on West Flamingo directly across
from the Palms and Gold Coast Casinos. It is one of the finest and most posh shops ever seen with luscious
wood flooring, custom ceiling and even custom hand-crafted cabinetry. It features special lighting and has some
of the best service anywhere. Once you are done buying, grab some free filtered and alkalized water along with
some free, fresh-popped movie-theater style popcorn that has over 10 toppings and extra butter to pour on top.
They are open 365 days a year from 8am to 3am and plan on going 24 hours once the law allows them to.
