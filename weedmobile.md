*Las Vegas, NV, July 5, 2017*: With recreational marijuana sales now in effect, one shop has a
unique idea that since last Saturday has been putting them well apart from all the other dispensaries in
Vegas, or Nevada, or the USA, or even the WORLD! The concept of having a truck & wrapping it in 10’
tall signs is nothing new. However, The Apothecary Shoppe's truck takes it further, way further with
what is dubbed the world’s 1st “Weedmobile” – complete with a 5.5’ tall bud picture coming straight from their
cultivation. There’s also a 6’ tall Mortimer Hawkins, the curator/welcomer of the Shoppe.
It wouldn’t be a Marijuana advertisement without weed-green colored LED lights surrounding each of
the 14’ tall signs. To top it all off they have a full speaker system on all sides of the truck so that you can hear it
coming by the music playing, as well as a disco light system in the cab & the classic Vegas fuzzy white dice hanging in
the front window to add that feel good party-type feel.
The sign directs you to their phone number, **1-833-GOT-HERB**, a play on the “Got Milk” ads we all know
& love. It says, “Call for a FREE ride” which is exactly what the shoppe wants – being that the tourists all over
Vegas & Downtown were left high & dry by lawmakers who still won’t allow deliveries to anyone who is
NOT a Nevada Medical Marijuana patient. This way every person from anywhere in the world can get a free
ride & get their herb without issue. The truck is ridden on a fixed route on LV BLVD from Mandalay Bay all
the way to Freemont Street & back again & can be seen mornings, noon, & night – even late night!
The Apothecary Shoppe is located 1 minute from the Las Vegas Strip, on West Flamingo directly across
from the Palms & Gold Coast Casinos. It is one of the finest & most posh shops ever seen with luscious
wood flooring, custom ceiling & even custom hand-crafted cabinetry. It features special lighting & has some
of the best service anywhere. Once you are done shopping, grab some free filtere, alkalized water along with
some free, fresh-popped movie-theater style popcorn that has over 10 toppings & extra butter to pour on top.
They are open 365 days a year from 8am to 3am & plan on going 24 hours once the law allows them to.

If you have never been to The Apothecary Shoppe I implore you to come check us out. We have very competitive pricing
